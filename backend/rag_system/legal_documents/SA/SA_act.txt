Residential Tenancies Act  1995 —28.4.2025 
Part 1 —Preliminary  
 
12 Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002   (3) If this Act provides that action may be taken after the expiration of a specified period 
of days, the period will be taken to be a period of clear days.  
 (4) For the purposes of this Act, a residential tenancy agreement includes an agreement granting a corporation the right to occupy premises that are occupied, or that are 
intended to be occupied, as a place of residence by a natural person.  
 (5) For the purposes of this Act — 
 (a) a reference to a rooming house is taken to include a reference to a designated

designated rooming house proprietor (within the meaning of Part  7 
Division  1A). 
Note — 
1 However, it should be noted that the Act confers certain protections against intrusion on 
the premises by the landlord. Hence, even if the agreement does not, in its terms, confer an exclusive right to occupation, the Act will (at least in some respects) assimilate the 
right of occupation to the exclusive right conferred by a lease.

term and the term was fixed at the tenant's request; or 
 (b) before the residential tenancy agreement was entered into— 
 (i) the landlord gave the tenant a  notice containing a warning in the 
form required by regulation; and 
 (ii) the tenant signed a statement in the form required by regulation 
acknowledging that the tenant did not expect to continue in 
possession of the premises after the end of the term sta ted in the 
agreement.

Preliminary —Part 1  
 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002  13 Example — 
An agreement under which a right of occupancy is given to a student

right of occupancy is given to a student in accommodation that is not 
within an educational institution or college).  
 (iii) club premises; or

 (c) an agreement genuinely entered into for the purpose of conferring on a person 
a right to occupy premises for a holiday; or  
 (d) an agreement conferring a right to occupy premises for the purpose of residence but under which no rent is payable; or  
Example — 
An agreement under which families exchange houses for an agreed period 
would not be a residential tenancy agreement if no rent were payable under the 
agreement.  
 (e) an agreement for the sale of land that confers a right to occupy premises for a 
period of 28 days or less on a party to the agreement; or 
 (f) a mortgage; or

 (i) a complex of adjacent premises is owned by a company; and  
 (ii) the premises are let by the company to persons who jointly have a controlling interest in the company; or  
 (h) a prescribed agreement or an agreement of a prescribed class.  
 (1a) The regulations may exclude prescribed classes of agreements that relate to land 
owned (wholly or in part) by the South Australian Housing Trust, or by a subsidiary of 
the South Australian Housing Trust, from the operation of subsection  (1)(e).  
 (1b) For the purposes of this Act, an agreement conferring a right to occupy premises for a 
fixed term of 60 days or longer is to be taken, in the absence of proof to the contrary, 
not to be an agreement referred to in subsection (1)(c).
