(b)
premises in which rooming accommodation is, or is to be, provided; or
(c)
inclusions for premises mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b); or
(d)
facilities in a moveable dwelling park.
(3)
A prescribed minimum housing standard may be about any matter relating to the premises, inclusions or facilities mentioned in subsection (2), including, for example, the following—
(a)
sanitation, drainage, cleanliness and repair of the premises, inclusions or facilities;
(b)
ventilation and insulation;
(c)

section 188
(2).
(5)
A regulation may also prescribe how compliance with minimum housing standards is to be monitored and enforced.

Purpose of division

Section 61
(which requires written agreements) applies to a long tenancy (moveable dwelling), but does not apply to a short tenancy (moveable dwelling).
2
Section 68

If the parties make a short tenancy statement, they may make another written statement (the

(2)
A short tenancy (extension) statement may only be made in the base period.
(3)
Only 1 short tenancy (extension) statement may be made about the tenancy.

The extended period may not be more than 42 days.

The tribunal may make the order if it is satisfied the tenant has established the ground of the application.
50
Short tenancies
For any period for which a short tenancy statement or short tenancy (extension) statement applies to the tenancy, the tenancy is a
short tenancy (moveable dwelling)
.

the entry is permitted by a warrant.
(2)
An authorised person, without the occupier’s agreement or a warrant, may—

(1)
An authorised person may apply to a magistrate for a warrant for a place.
(2)
The application must be sworn and must state the grounds on which the warrant is sought.
(3)
The magistrate may refuse to consider the application until the authorised person gives the magistrate all the information the magistrate requires about the application in the way the magistrate requires.
Example—
The magistrate may require additional information supporting the application be given by statutory declaration.
(4)
The magistrate may issue a warrant only if the magistrate is satisfied there are reasonable grounds for suspecting—
(a)
there is a particular thing or activity (the
evidence
) that may provide evidence of the commission of an offence against this Act; and
(b)
the evidence is at the place, or may be at the place within the next 7 days.

the authorised person may, with necessary and reasonable help and force, enter the place and exercise the authorised person’s powers under this Act; and
(b)
the evidence for which the warrant is issued; and
(c)
the hours of the day or night when entry may be made; and
(d)
the day (within 14 days after the warrant’s issue) when the warrant ends.
(6)
The magistrate must record the reasons for issuing the warrant.
442
Warrants—applications made other than in person
(1)
An authorised person may apply for a warrant by phone, fax, radio or another form of communication if the authorised person considers it necessary because of urgent circumstances or other special circumstances, including, for example, the authorised person’s remote location.
(2)
Before applying for the warrant, the authorised person must prepare an application stating the grounds on which the warrant is sought.
(3)
The authorised person may apply for the warrant before the application is sworn.
(4)
After issuing a warrant, the magistrate must immediately fax a copy (the
facsimile warrant
) to the authorised person if it is reasonably practicable to fax the copy.
(5)
If it is not reasonably practicable to fax a copy of the warrant to the authorised person—
(a)
the magistrate must—

record on the warrant the reasons for issuing the warrant; and
(ii)
tell the authorised person the date and time the warrant was signed; and
(iii)
tell the authorised person the warrant’s terms; and
(b)
the authorised person must write on a form of warrant (the
warrant form
)—
(i)
the magistrate’s name; and
(ii)
the date and time the magistrate signed the warrant; and
(iii)
the warrant’s terms.
(6)
The facsimile warrant, or the warrant form properly completed by the authorised person, authorises the entry and the exercise of the other powers mentioned in the warrant issued by the magistrate.

(a)
the sworn application; and
(b)
if a warrant form was completed by the authorised person—the completed warrant form.
(8)
On receiving the documents, the magistrate must attach them to the warrant.

the warrant is not produced in evidence.

search any part of the place; or

examine, inspect, test, photograph or film anything at the place; or
(c)
copy a document at the place; or
(d)
seize a document at the place if the authorised person reasonably believes the document is evidence of an offence against this Act and the seizure is necessary to prevent the document—
(i)
being hidden, lost or destroyed; or
(ii)
being used to commit, continue or repeat the offence; or
(e)
take into the place any persons, equipment and materials the authorised person reasonably requires for exercising a power in relation to the place; or

(3)
If the help is required to be given by—
(a)
answering a question; or
(b)
producing a document (other than an authority or other document required to be kept by the person under this Act or another Act);
it is a reasonable excuse for the person to fail to answer the question, or produce the document, if complying with the requirement might tend to incriminate the person.
(4)
This section applies to an authorised person who enters a place to get the occupier’s agreement only if the agreement is given or the entry is otherwise authorised.
Part 3
Other enforcement matters

(4)
The nominated person must comply with the requirement, unless the person has a reasonable excuse.
