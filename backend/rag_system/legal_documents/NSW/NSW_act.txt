A tenant who fails to comply with an order for possession of the Tribunal is liable to pay an occupation fee to the landlord for the period the tenant remains in possession of the residential premises after the date the tenant is required to vacate the premises.
(2)
The occupation fee payable is an amount equal to the rent that would have been payable for that period if the residential tenancy agreement had not been terminated.
(3)
The amount of the occupation fee may be deducted from the rental bond paid by the tenant for the residential premises.
(4)
The Tribunal may, on application by the landlord, order the tenant to pay to the landlord an amount of occupation fee.

plaintiff
) who is not the landlord or former landlord under the agreement.
(2)
The court or Tribunal must not give judgment or make an order for possession, unless it is satisfied—
(a)
as to whether or not there is a person in possession of the residential premises as a tenant under a residential tenancy agreement or a former tenant holding over after termination of a residential tenancy agreement, and
(b)
that any such person has had reasonable notice of the proceedings brought by the plaintiff.
(3)
Failure to comply with this section does not invalidate or otherwise affect the judgment or order.

(a)
a tenant under a residential tenancy agreement, or
(b)
a former tenant holding over after termination of a residential tenancy agreement.
(3)
The application may be made to—
(a)
the court or Tribunal before which the proceedings are pending, or

if the proceedings have been completed—the Tribunal,
and must be made within the period prescribed by the regulations after the applicant was given notice of the proceedings or (if no notice was given) within a reasonable time after the completion of the proceedings and before possession of the premises is recovered.
(4)
The court or Tribunal may, on such an application, and if it thinks it appropriate to do so in the special circumstances of the case, make an order vesting a tenancy over the residential premises in the applicant.
(5)
The plaintiff is to be the landlord under the tenancy and the tenancy is to be on such terms and conditions as the court or Tribunal thinks fit, having regard to the circumstances of the case.
(6)
Such an application or order may be made before possession of the premises is recovered, even though—
(a)
notice was not given to the applicant of the proceedings brought by the plaintiff, or
(b)
the proceedings brought by the plaintiff have been completed.

(a)
the social housing premises to which the agreement relates,
(b)
any property adjoining or adjacent to those premises (including any property that is available for use by the tenant in common with others).

The operation of an acceptable behaviour agreement extends to the behaviour of any other person occupying (or jointly occupying) the social housing premises with the consent of the tenant (a
lawful occupier
). Accordingly, if any such lawful occupier engages in any anti-social behaviour that is specified in the agreement, the tenant is taken to have engaged in the behaviour and breached the agreement.

(a)
the history of the tenancy concerned, or
(b)
the history of any prior tenancy under a social housing tenancy agreement entered into by the tenant and the Corporation,

Scheme for recording strikes against tenant for breaches
(1)
If a landlord under a social housing tenancy agreement is satisfied that a tenant has breached the agreement but is not satisfied that the circumstances of the breach taken alone justify termination of the agreement, the landlord may issue a strike notice to the tenant and record a strike against the tenant.
(2)
A strike notice—
(a)
must be in writing, and
(b)
must inform the tenant that a strike has been recorded against the tenant, and
(c)
must set out details of the alleged breach of the agreement for which the strike has been recorded, and
(d)
must remind the tenant of any strikes that have been recorded (and not withdrawn) against the tenant within the previous 12 months (including strikes recorded for breach of a prior social housing tenancy agreement with the same or, to the extent that relevant information is known by the landlord, a different landlord), and
(e)
must warn the tenant that, if a third strike is recorded against the tenant within 12 months, a termination notice may be given to the tenant, and
(f)
must inform the tenant that, if the tenant disagrees with the statement of details of the alleged breach of the agreement for which the strike has been recorded, or any aspect of those details, the tenant should make submissions to the landlord setting out the grounds of the disagreement, and
(g)
must specify how the submissions may be made and the date before which they must be made (being a date not less than 21 days after the date of the strike notice), and
(h)
must inform the tenant that, if the tenant does not make any such submissions, the details of the alleged breach of the agreement set out in the strike notice will be taken, in proceedings before the Tribunal, to have been conclusively proved and the tenant will not be able to challenge the accuracy of those details.
(3)
A landlord may withdraw a strike against a tenant at any time.
(4)
If, after considering submissions made by a tenant as set out in a strike notice, the landlord decides not to withdraw the strike, the landlord must give the tenant a notice in writing—
(a)
informing the tenant of that decision and that the tenant may apply for review of the strike notice, and
(b)
specifying how the application may be made and the date before which it must be made (being a date not less than 21 days after the date of the notice).
(5)
If an application for review of a strike notice is made by a tenant, the landlord must refer the matter to a review panel comprised of one or more persons who were not substantially involved in the process of making the decision under review and who are, in the opinion of the landlord, otherwise suitably qualified to deal with the issues raised by the application.
(6)
On a review, the review panel must consider any information submitted by the tenant and may—
(a)
confirm the strike against the tenant, or
(b)
require the strike against the tenant to be withdrawn.
(7)
A landlord is bound by a decision of a review panel requiring a strike against a tenant to be withdrawn.
(8)
A landlord must, on application by a tenant, provide the tenant with information about any strikes recorded (and not withdrawn) against the tenant (unless that information has already been provided to the tenant within the last 3 months and no further strikes have been recorded against the tenant since the information was last provided).
(9)
If 2 strikes have been recorded against the tenant within the previous 12 months and the landlord is satisfied that the tenant has breached the social housing tenancy agreement and that a further strike notice could be issued to the tenant, the landlord may—
(a)
record a strike against the tenant without issuing a further strike notice, and
(b)
give a termination notice under section 87C on the basis that the landlord is satisfied that a series of breaches by the tenant of the agreement or any prior social housing tenancy agreement with the same or a different landlord justifies termination of the agreement with the tenant.
(10)
The termination notice—
(a)
must inform the tenant that a strike has been recorded against the tenant and set out details of the alleged breach of the agreement for which the strike has been recorded, and
(b)
must remind the tenant of the details of any other strikes relied on by the landlord for giving the notice.

(3)
However—
(a)
subsection (1)(a) does not apply if the application for the termination order is based on an act of a person who although not a tenant is occupying or jointly occupying the residential premises and not on an act of the tenant, and

who is occupying or jointly occupying the social housing premises, and
(c)

(4)
For the purposes of the application of section 91(1)(b) to social housing premises under this section—

the reference to residential premises in section 91(1)(b) is to be taken to be a reference to the social housing premises or any property adjoining or adjacent to the premises (including any property that is available for use by the tenant in common with others), and
(b)
if the Tribunal is satisfied that an offence of a kind referred to in subsection (1)(c) or (2)(b) has been committed by a person on the social housing premises or any property adjoining or adjacent to the premises (including any property that is available for use by the tenant in common with others), the Tribunal must assume that—
(i)
the premises or property has been used for an unlawful purpose, and
(ii)
the use is sufficient to justify termination of the agreement.
(5)
If the Tribunal does not make a termination order as a consequence of subsection (3), the Tribunal must provide written reasons for the decision.
