85    (3) An additional amount of bond under subsection (2) is an amount determined by—  (a) calculating a total amount of bond for the next 5 year period of the residential rental agreement by using the rent payable at the commencement of the next 5 year period of the residential rental agreement as a basis for that bond's calculation; and  (b) subtracting the total amount of bond currently lodged with the Authority from the total amount of bond calculated under paragraph (a). Example For the first 5 year period of a residential rental agreement, the rent payable is $400 per week. The bond is 4 weeks rent, or $1600. For the next 5 year period of the residential rental agreement, occurring immediately after the first period, the rent payable is increased to $520 per week. The bond amount calculated by 4 weeks rent at the new amount of rent payable ($520 per week) is $2080. If a term referred to in this section is included in the residential rental agreement, the residential rental provider would be permitted to require the renter to pay an additional amount of bond for $480. This amount is proportionate to the increase in rent payable under the residential rental agreement.

510    (3) In calculating an amount of compensation payable on an application under section 210 or 210B for early termination of a residential rental agreement by the renter, or of a site agreement by the site tenant, the Tribunal must—  (a) determine advertising costs and reletting fees (if any) incurred by the residential rental provider or the site owner (as the case requires) on a basis that is proportionate to the actual cost of securing the renter or the site tenant; and Example A renter has lived in rented premises under a residential rental agreement, on terms including a 12 month fixed term, rent of $500 per week and a reletting fee of $500. The renter notifies the property manager that the renter will terminate the rental agreement 6 months before the end of the fixed term. The property manager advertises the rented premises for rent immediately and finds a new renter. The advertising costs were $250. The new renter enters the premises one week after the previous renter vacates the premises. The residential rental provider's costs of advertising and reletting fees are $1000, which is the sum of one week's rent ($500), the reletting fee pro-rated for 6 months of the unexpired term of the agreement ($250) and advertising costs ($250).  (b) determine the amount of compensation for loss of rent (if any) by taking into account what loss could reasonably have been mitigated by the residential rental provider or the site owner (as the case requires) by promptly reletting the rented premises or the Part 4A site; and  (c) have regard to any severe hardship the renter or the site tenant would have been expected to suffer due to an unforseen change in circumstances, if the residential rental 
 
  Part 5—Compensation and compliance    Residential Tenancies Act 1997 No. 109 of 1997 
511   agreement or site agreement had continued; and  (d) not award any compensation for loss of future rent to the residential rental provider, or the site owner (as the case requires), if the residential rental provider or the site owner served a notice to vacate on the renter or the site tenant, unless the notice was served because the renter or the site tenant terminated or repudiated the residential rental agreement or the site agreement; and  (e) determine compensation payable after a renter or a site tenant has given the residential rental provider or the site owner a notice of intention to vacate under section 91ZB, 91ZC or 207S. Note Section 91ZH applies to advanced payments of rent by a renter to a residential rental provider after the rented premises have been abandoned by the renter.  (4) If the Tribunal is determining an application under section 210 in respect of a claim by a residential rental provider for unpaid rent in a residential rental agreement for a fixed term of more than 5 years that has been terminated early, the Tribunal may not award an amount of compensation in excess of a maximum of one month's rent under the agreement for each 12 month period of the unexpired term of the agreement.  (5) In the case of an application referred to in subsection (1)(a), the Tribunal must take into account whether a renter who was required to give written notice under section 72AA has given that notice to the residential rental provider.
